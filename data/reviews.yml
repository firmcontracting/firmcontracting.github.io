      Adriano and his team did an amazing job on our exterior renovation project. We poured 2000+ sqft of exposed
      aggregate concrete, built a retaining wall, and installed a fence. Adriano was super detail oriented and made sure
      everything was done to perfection. He was also very responsive and easy to work with. I would highly recommend
      Adriano and his team!

      I had a massive project to do, which started as a complete gut of my place. I had heard from several friends that 
      Adriano was the man for what I was planning. Fast forward 2 years later with several months of work each winter 
      since I had to split my main floor & basement time line, and I basically have a brand new home that has a shell 
      of 100+ years.

      Adriano was exceptional, hard working and the outcome of the project was better then asked. He made an exposed 
      aggregate patio with matching garden edge trim, it will make our backyard look amazing year round.
